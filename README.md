Introduction to the DataProc Framework
=========

### About DataProc

DataProc is an implementation framework that allows you to run native code within the Hadoop execution framework. 
Pairing the performance and flexibility of natively developed algorithms with the unfettered scalability and throughput inherent in Hadoop, 
DataProc enables large-scale deployment of advanced data processing applications.

### Map to this repo

This repository includes user guide, tutorials and source code for the DataProc framework.
We suggest you run through this repo in the following order:

  1. Ensure that you have all dependencies and build (see below).
  2. Test that DataProc install was successful
    - Run `test_dataproc.sh` from the test directory
  3. Study up on DataProc
    - README.md in the UserGuide directory covers the basic concepts behind DataProc
  4. Run through the example algorithms in the tutorial directory
  5. Build your own algorithm using the examples as templates and let us know if you have questions or comments!
